\section{Kernel functions}
We saw how easy a linearly separable binary classification instance 
would be, the idea now is to work on non separable data to see what 
we can do.

\paragraph{Feature expansion}
We now consider a function $\Phi$ that maps the original 
data to a higher dimensional space, an example could be
$$\Phi(x_1, x_2) = (1, x_1^2, x_2^2, x_1, x_2, x_1 x_2)$$
The function starts from a two-dimensional space and ends up 
in a six-dimensional one.

\paragraph{High dimensional hyperplane}
If we consider an homogeneous hyperplane in a high dimensional space, 
we get 
$$\{ z \in \mathbb{R}^6 : w^Tz = 0 \}, w \in \mathbb{R}^6$$
